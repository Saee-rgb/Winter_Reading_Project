	2. Categorical predictor & Categorical response then which algorithm?
	3. Is error rate for K Nearest Neighbors defined in same way as Baye's classifier? 
	4. Shark attacks and ice cream sale example - temperature is the latent variable. 
            How to find out existence of latent variable when it is some unknown problem.
	5. What is the difference in confidence interval and prediction interval? 
	6. How to know which interacting terms should be added in multiple linear regression when there are many predictors?(Trial and error can't be the method right?) 
	7. Problematic amount of collinearity exists between the predictor if VIF > 5 or VIF >10 . I didnâ€™t understand this statement. 
	8. How to decide if we have to take transformation or consider interaction effect?  6 & 8 : is there any algorithm? 
	9. As non parametric methods do not assume any functional form does it imply that they do not have any loss function optimization problem inside them? Example : KNN
	10. How to know for which values of K , we are not overfitting in KNN ? (Ex: K = 1 is definitely an overfit) 
	11. ESL : Cross Validation  :  ? 
	12. N/k is defined as degrees of freedom for KNN. Why is it so and what is it's interpretation? 
	13. How to read ESL faster?
	14. How to avoid confusion in R and Python? I found Python is not very similar to R.
	15. ISLR Chapter 3 : Q10 : (b) , ( c ) .How to interpret the  coefficients ? 
	 Why is R^2 value very less? 
	16. Is question ISLR Chapter 3 : Q9 correct?
